Web application for pick-up basketball

Problem description
	Each user must create an account when first accessing the application. The user must send only a few 
fields such as name and email to the database. There are other fields that should be completed but are not
mandatory, the fields relating to other personal details and contact means. I am looking for an efficient
way to create the User objects, while at the same time not giving values for all the existing fields in
the database. The rest of the fields are: isAdmin, age, facebook and game, an interface that allows the 
user to create a game or participate to a match.

Advantages
- the creation and initialization of an user object is more flexible
- the complex user instance is created independently of the fields that are part of it

Disadvantages
- increases the complexity of the code because this design pattern forces the programmer to add some other
classes in the solution
- this pattern doesn't account for human error, that being missing a few attributes when initializing the
user, even if you meant to do it
