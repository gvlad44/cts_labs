Web application for pick-up basketball

Problem description
	In the user interface, on the homepage, there is a table which displays the user the matches they
signed up for. Now, for the creator of the match there must be added 3 more buttons at run time, one for displaying
match details, one for checking in of the attending users and one for deleting the match.

Advantages
- The table class is modified at run time and is not modified for normal users
- If needed other decorators can be added

Disadvantages
- The code complexity increases, since a few classes are added
- When calling the decorators we can break clean code when naming variables of the same type
