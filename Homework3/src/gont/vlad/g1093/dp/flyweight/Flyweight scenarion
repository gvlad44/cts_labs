Web application for pick-up basketball

Problem description
	The public matches interface has a lot of games available, each one having a visual interface, that 
contain the same components for the data and are of the same shape. Each card has an animation which is of
different colour and speed. The animation requires a significant space and an efficient way of dealing 
with them is needed from a memory point of view.

Advantages
- working with immutable classes
- reducing memory usage by sharing the same state

Disadvantages
- hard to implement
- not worth to implement when working with a small number of objects, each having small dimensions in the 
memory
