Web application for pick-up basketball

Problem description
	In order to improve the experience each user has with the application, I came up with a page through
which users can share their feedback with the developers. At the moment there are a few types of messages
users can send, such as: standard, bug, feedback and other. Each category has different attributes and 
there is a slight chance that in the future they will change or other types will be added.

Advantages
- all created messages have a common interface
- can add other types of messages easily, there is no need to modify most of the existing code
- implements DIP

Disadvantages
- the user is limited to a single interface for all the objects
- increases the complexity of the application
