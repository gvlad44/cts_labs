Web application for pick-up basketball

Problem description
	Whenever the developer resets the database, the application must generate a few matches that will 
appear in the "Public matches" page. Each card has a few details and an animation that appears on it. 
These cards will have the same animation. The process of rendering the animation is expensive because
it needs a lot of resources for the loading time and displaying the animation.

Advantages
- create clones of an object rather quick and efficient
- avoids calling the constructor directly

Disadvantages
- shallow copy can appear if the pattern is not implemented properly
- if the application has a few objects, the use of this pattern is not necessary
- each subclass will implement clone(), which can be a hard thing to do properly on manage well
