Code refactoring

Category:

Meaningful names
- add a suggestive package name and rename the package from the received class
- rename class name to be more suggestive -> LoanAccount
- rename class variable loan_value to -> loanValue
- rename to_string() function using naming conventions -> toString()
- rename loan() function to be more suggestive -> getLoanValue()
- rename setValue() function to be more suggestive -> setLoanValue()
- rename setLoanValue() parameter's to be more suggestive -> loanValue
- rename constructor parameter to be more suggestive value -> loanValue
- rename function calculate() to be more suggestive -> computeBrokerTotalFee()
- rename variable account_Type to -> loanAccountType
- rename constructor parameter account_Type to -> loanAccountType
- rename function print() to -> printStatement()
- rename variable totalFee to -> brokerTotalFee

Format code
- format code using Ctrl + Shift + F
- added brackets for if statements with a single instruction
- moved both constructors to the top of the class for better clarity

Functions
- add this to the return line of setLoanValue()
- add this to the return line of getLoanValue()
- add this to this.loanValue in public constructor
- created computeInterestPrincipal() function so that computeBrokerTotalFee() respects
 Single Responsibility principle 
- getRate() does 2 things so split it into 2 functions
- getLoanValue() does 2 things so split it into 2 functions
- created constructor with ValidationInterface as a parameter

Methods
- validate constructor parameter rate
- validate computeBrokerTotalFee() parameters
- deleted unused variable vb from function print();
- remove variable temp and make it a final variable -> NO_DAYS_IN_YEAR
- remove hard-coded value 365 from computeBrokerTotalFee
- remove hard-coded value 0.125 and made a final variable -> BROKER_FEE
- generated getter and setter for daysActive

Exceptions
- added throws declaration to computeBrokerTotalFee()
- created 3 custom exceptions and implemented them instead of the standard exception
- remove the dependency regarding the validations for the input

Comments
- removed comment from getMonthlyRate()
- removed comment from computeBrokerTotalFee()
- removed comment regarding interest-principal from computeBrokerTotalFee()

Enums and Annotations
- made account_Type from int to enum -> loanAccountType
